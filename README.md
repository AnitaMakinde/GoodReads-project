# 📚 Goodreads Power BI Project

Welcome to my **Goodreads Power BI Project**! This project explores the books that have been logged on the Goodreads platform up until **2020**, focusing on Publishing dates, Publishers, Authors, and most common languages books are read in. 📖🌍

## 🚀 Project Overview
In this projet I analysed a dataset from Goodreads using **Power BI**. The goal was to uncover insights about the books logged on the platform by users.  

Goodreads is a website that lets users track their reading and share their taste in books to the world. It's an online community for bookworms, and an opportunity to discover new books your friends have liked. I myself am a massive bookie so this dataset was fascinating to look through. I downloaded this dataset from Kaggle.

## 🔧 Tools and Techniques

- **Power BI**:  
  - 🧹 *Data Cleaning*: Using Query Editor I removed duplicates, formatted the data, and handled missing values.    
  - 🖼️ *Data Visualization*: Created interactive dashboards to bring the data to life!
